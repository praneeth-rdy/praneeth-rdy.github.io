Initially, I had decided not to pursue any internship that summer. Instead, I was focusing on preparing for placements and learning DSA. However, my preparation routine soon started to feel monotonous, and I was looking for something to break the cycle. That‚Äôs when I received an email from PRC, Gymkhana of IIT KGP, about a talk by a KGP alumnus who had founded a startup. Along with the talk, there was also an announcement seeking interns to join this startup.</p>\n<p>Out of curiosity‚Äîand partly to get away from my monotonic preparation‚ÄîI filled out the form. A few days later, I received an email asking me to share my introduction and answer some questions about my candidature. I was soon shortlisted for an interview with Pradip (the CTO of Trumio).</p>\n<p>The interview process was intense. I was asked about core CS concepts mentioned in my CV, technical details of my past projects, and system design questions. After three rounds of interviews, I was selected as an intern at Trumio.</p>\n<h2>The Internship Journey</h2>\n<p>For two continuous months, I worked as a full-time intern and then continued as a part-time intern for one more month. However, I had to take a break after that to focus on my placements. My efforts paid off‚ÄîI secured a Day-1 offer to join <strong>Corridor Platforms</strong> as a Full Stack Developer during the campus placements at IIT Kharagpur.</p>\n<p>After my placements, I was welcomed back to Trumio to rejoin as an intern. That led to me working at Trumio for a few more months, starting in January and continuing till March, with some breaks during my semester exams. By the end of March, I had to stop again as my final semester was packed with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thesis project</li>\n<li>Comprehensive viva</li>\n<li>Semester exams</li>\n<li>And, of course, parties! üéâ</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Transition to Full-time üöÄ</h2>\n<p>As my joining date at Corridor Platforms approached, I got a message from Pradip inviting me to rejoin as an intern until I relocated and started working with Corridor Platforms. During a call with him, we talked about my future goals, interests, and work. Our discussion gradually led to my interest in joining Trumio full-time if I had an opportunity. I took some time to think it through and shared that I was indeed interested, having enjoyed working there over the past few months. That moment led me to land a full-time Software Engineer role at Trumio. I was asked to join immediately, given the importance of the ongoing work.</p>\n<h2>Growing Responsibilities üìà</h2>\n<p>As an intern, I used to work on both Backend and Frontend. In my initial full-time days at Trumio, I focused on the Backend, building some interesting value additions to the platform. I later contributed to full-stack features and helped ship them. One particularly fascinating project I worked on was related to <em>Infrastructure as a Service</em>. Our team offsites were filled with fun and learning.</p>\n<p>It was during the second offsite that things started to change from a product perspective. We began refining our product at Trumio to make it more valuable for our customers and to better meet their needs and wants. We established a new value and started building around it. This was when I became more involved with the Frontend stack. It was a lot of fun‚Äîa true roller-coaster ride for the next couple of months. I found myself wearing multiple hats as needed by the team including an engineer, project manager, team lead, and more.</p>\n<p>I started feeling more ‚Äústartup-ish.‚Äù ‚ú®</p>\n<h2>Current Role üéØ</h2>\n<p>Soon, I was asked to take up responsibilities as a Technical Lead for the team, especially for the Frontend. Both my managers-cum-leads were pulled into another critical area of the company, leaving me to step up.</p>\n<p>Now, I‚Äôm just starting this new journey, and I‚Äôm very excited to see how things unfold. I‚Äôm ready to face any challenges that come my way and view each step as an opportunity to learn and grow. My goal is to stay balanced‚Äînot to underdo or overdo things.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Journey at a Startup","date":"March 15, 2024","subtext":"From breaking the monotony of placement preparation to leading the frontend team at a startup - my professional growth story at Trumio Inc."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/my-journey-at-a-startup/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/react-local-scoping/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Adding CSS Styles in React"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/living-asynchronously/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Living Asynchronously"}}}},
